# [Code Challenge] Todo List


## [Backend]
    - I decided to go with Spring Boot in order to demonstrate I bit of my knowledge with the tool since
    I could be assigned to tasks that makes use of it.
    - The dependecies used are
        * Spring Web
        * Spring JPA
        * Spring Security
        * Lombok
        * H2 Database
    - I chose DAO designed pattern to isolate business logic from persistence
    - The server is going to run on port 8383
    - I also added Swagger dependency so the Rest Controllers can be easily tested (http://localhost:8383/swagger-ui.html)
    - Initially I wanted to use form login with security but I didn't have to implement it, so all requests are done through Basic Auth, unfortunately.
    - I created the TodoUser class in a way that it could be used as the user of the tasks and login at the same time

## [Frontend]
    - The technology chosen for the frontend was Angular with Angular Material for the styling
    - It has a login page that redirects to tasks page after user is successful logged in
